The Linux operating system comprises several different pieces:

1. **Bootloader -** The software that manages the boot process of a computer. For most users, this will simply be a splash screen that pops up and eventually goes away to boot into the operating system.

2. **Kernel –** The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS.

3. **Init system –** It is the init system that manages the boot process, once the initial booting is handed over from the bootloader.

4. **Daemons –** These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that either start up during boot or after you log into the desktop.

5. **Graphical server –** This is the sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server or just X.

7. **Applications –** Linux offers thousands upon thousands of high-quality software titles that can be easily found and installed.


# Why use Linux?
 
**Linux** has evolved into one of the most reliable computer ecosystems. Combine that reliability with zero cost of entry and we have the perfect solution for a desktop platform.

Linux is also distributed under an open source license. Open source follows these key tenets:

- The freedom to run the program.
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
- The freedom to redistribute copies.
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

 Linux is an operating system famously known as “by the people, for the people”.  It’s about freedom and freedom of use and freedom of choice.
