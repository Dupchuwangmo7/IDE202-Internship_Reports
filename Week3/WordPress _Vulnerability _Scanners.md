# What is WordPress?
It is a web content management system. It also support publishing other web content including more traditional websites.

WordPress is written in the PHP language and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database.

It stores content and enables a user to create and publish webpages, requiring nothing beyond a domain and a hosting service.

## Themes
Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content.

Custom code can be added to the website by using a child theme or through a code editor.

## Plugins
WordPress' plugin architecture allows users to extend or depreciate the features and functionality of a website or blog.

Plugins could also be used by hackers targeting sites that use WordPress, as hackers could exploit bugs in WordPress plugins instead of bugs in WordPress itself.
